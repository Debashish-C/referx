# ReferX Platform

## Introduction
ReferX is a unique referral-based platform where any industry or individual can list their courses or products for sponsorship and sale. The platform allows users to refer these listed items to others and earn coins as rewards for successful referrals and purchases.

## How ReferX Works

1. **Listing Products/Courses:**
   - Any industry, teacher, or individual can list their courses or products on the ReferX platform.
   - The listed items will be available for purchase directly on the ReferX website.

2. **Referral System:**
   - Users can share referral links for listed products/courses.
   - When someone uses the referral link to sign up on ReferX, the referrer earns coins.
   - If the referred person makes a purchase through the platform, the referrer earns additional coins.

3. **Earning Rewards:**
   - Coins earned through referrals can be accumulated and potentially redeemed according to the platform's reward policies.

4. **Affordable for All:**
   - ReferX charges a nominal fee for listing products or courses, making it accessible for everyone — from independent educators to businesses.

## Example Use Case
- Imagine you are a teacher with an online course but struggling to reach more students.
- You list your course on ReferX.
- Other users on the platform start referring your course.
- Whenever someone signs up using a referral link, the referrer earns coins.
- If the referred person purchases your course, the referrer earns even more coins.
- You benefit from increased course sales, while the referrer gains rewards.

## Why Choose ReferX?
